Hi, I‚Äôm *Aashritha*! üëãüèª  

I‚Äôm a third-year Computer Science student at STLW, Hyderabad, India.  

I enjoy exploring machine learning, building websites just for fun, and sharing notes to make exam prep easier (and way less stressful). ü§ì‚òùüèº  

These notes are crafted to make your **college exam prep** easier, smarter, and maybe even a *little fun* ‚ú®
